# CodeRabbit Issues Fixed and Verification Log

Date: 2025-10-06

This log documents fixes implemented in response to CodeRabbit-style review concerns and follow-up stability work.

## Frontend build and type errors

1) group-page.tsx merge artifacts and syntax errors
- Symptoms: Vite/esbuild failed with "Unexpected '{'" and multiple TS parse errors.
- Fix: Rebuilt interfaces and state wiring cleanly:
  - Introduced GroupDetails, Expense, and GroupView interfaces.
  - Rewrote fetchGroupDetails with clear phases and robust typing.
  - Ensured member status and invite inference are safe and optional.
- Files:
  - src/components/group-page.tsx

2) add-expense-modal.tsx async/await and split calculation corruption
- Symptoms: "await can only be used inside an async function" and undefined variable 'splits'.
- Fix: Restored proper handleSubmit signature and validated split calculations.
  - Added missing local 'splits' declaration.
  - Repaired equal vs custom split branches and error messaging.
  - Restored handleMemberToggle to a simple, reliable toggle with 2-person guard.
- Files:
  - src/components/add-expense-modal.tsx

3) Missing dependency: @supabase/supabase-js
- Symptoms: Rollup failed to resolve import in src/lib/supabase.ts
- Fix: Installed @supabase/supabase-js@2 and re-built successfully.
- Files:
  - package.json (dependencies)

## Backend alignment (Supabase)
- Edge Function invite-user present with CORS handled and JWT verification.
- Migrations include RLS hardening and profiles.display_name per PR_NOTES.md.
- RPC functions referenced by the app are defined in migrations (accept_group_invitation, get_group_members_with_status, settle_group_debt, etc.).

## How to verify

Frontend
- Build: npm run build (should succeed)
- Preview: npm run dev and navigate to group and expense flows.

Backend (requires .env.local configured with VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- Automated: npm run test:backend
- Manual: Follow QA_TEST_SCRIPT.md for end-to-end flows (invites, RLS, activity, balances).

Supabase migrations and Edge Functions
- Apply policies and profile changes: run scripts in supabase/migrations or use Supabase SQL editor.
- Deploy invite-user: supabase functions deploy invite-user

## Notes / Future
- If you see any remaining RLS recursion, run fix-rls-recursion.sql in the SQL editor.
- Consider adding CI to run the backend test script in a preview environment.
