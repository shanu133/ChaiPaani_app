# Email Invitation Investigation Report
**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Branch:** feature/smtp-invites  
**Status:** üîç Investigation Complete - Action Items Below

---

## ‚úÖ BUGS FIXED

### 1. **Critical: Corrupted smtp-send Edge Function**
**Issue:** The `withTimeout` function was malformed with duplicate code accidentally pasted inside it, causing the function to fail.

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// Before: Missing try/catch and cleanup logic
async function withTimeout<T>(...): Promise<T> {
  ...
  // CODE MISSING - Function was broken
}

// After: Complete implementation
async function withTimeout<T>(
  promise: Promise<T>,
  timeoutMs: number,
  operationName: string
): Promise<T> {
  let timeoutId: number | undefined;
  
  const timeoutPromise = new Promise<never>((_, reject) => {
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      reject(new Error(`${operationName} timed out after ${timeoutMs}ms`));
    }, timeoutMs);
  });

  try {
    const result = await Promise.race([promise, timeoutPromise]);
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**Impact:** This was preventing emails from being sent at all. The Edge Function would crash before reaching the SMTP send logic.

---

### 2. **Critical: Corrupted inviteUser Function**
**Issue:** The `inviteUser` function in `supabase-service.ts` was missing catch blocks and had duplicate debug logging.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added missing `catch` block for legacy email invite path
- Removed duplicate debug logging code
- Ensured proper error handling for both SMTP and legacy paths

**Impact:** This could cause the frontend to hang or show incomplete error messages when email sending failed.

---

### 3. **Code Quality: Duplicate resendInvite Function**
**Issue:** There were two `resendInvite` functions defined in the same service, causing confusion and potential runtime errors.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed the duplicate function definition
- Kept the simpler version that directly calls the SMTP function

---

### 4. **Code Quality: Incomplete acceptInviteById Function**
**Issue:** The `acceptInviteById` function was defined but had no implementation body.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added deprecation message directing users to use `acceptByToken` instead
- Prevents runtime errors if old code tries to call this function

---

## üîç CURRENT CONFIGURATION STATUS

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
1. **SMTP Enabled:** `VITE_ENABLE_SMTP=true` in `.env`
2. **Edge Function Deployed:** `smtp-send` function is deployed
3. **SMTP Secrets:** All 8 secrets configured in Supabase dashboard
4. **Test Emails:** Direct SMTP test emails working (confirmed in terminal history)
5. **App URL:** Set to `http://localhost:3001` for invitation links
6. **Authentication:** Working correctly
7. **Database:** Invitations table and RLS policies configured

### üìß SMTP Configuration:
- **Provider:** Gmail SMTP
- **Host:** smtp.gmail.com
- **Port:** 465 (SSL/TLS)
- **From:** chaipaaniapp@gmail.com
- **Timeout:** 30 seconds (configurable via SMTP_TIMEOUT_MS)

## üö® WHY EMAILS MIGHT NOT BE ARRIVING

### Most Likely Causes:

#### 1. **Gmail Spam Filtering**
**Probability:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Very High)

**Issue:** Gmail is very aggressive with emails from new/unverified senders. Your emails are likely being delivered but ending up in spam.

**Action Required:**
1. ‚úÖ Check your spam/junk folder thoroughly
2. ‚úÖ Mark the email as "Not Spam" if found
3. ‚úÖ Add chaipaaniapp@gmail.com to your contacts
4. For production, consider:
   - Adding SPF record to your domain
   - Setting up DKIM signing
   - Configuring DMARC policy
   - Using a verified sending domain

---

#### 2. **Gmail "Less Secure App" Settings**
**Probability:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (High)

**Issue:** Even with App Password, Gmail might throttle or block emails if the sending account doesn't have proper authentication.

**Action Required:**
1. Verify the App Password is still valid
2. Check if Google has sent security alerts to chaipaaniapp@gmail.com
3. Ensure 2FA is enabled on the Gmail account
4. Try regenerating the App Password

---

#### 3. **Rate Limiting**
**Probability:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium)

**Issue:** Gmail has sending limits (500/day for personal accounts, 2000/day for Workspace).

**Action Required:**
1. Check if you've hit rate limits
2. Monitor Edge Function logs for rate limit errors
3. Consider upgrading to Google Workspace for higher limits

---

#### 4. **Email Content Triggers**
**Probability:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low-Medium)

**Issue:** The email content might trigger spam filters due to:
- Generic "invitation" subject lines
- Links in the body
- No plain text version
- No unsubscribe link

**Action Required:**
1. Add plain text version to all emails (currently HTML only)
2. Consider adding an unsubscribe footer
3. Make subject lines more specific
4. Add sender information in footer

---

#### 5. **Edge Function Errors**
**Probability:** ‚≠ê (Low - Now Fixed)

**Issue:** The corrupted code was causing Edge Function failures.

**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Functions are now syntactically correct

**Action Required:**
1. Re-deploy the Edge Function with fixes:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy smtp-send --no-verify-jwt
   ```

---

## üîß DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS PROVIDED

### 1. **Email Flow Test Script**
**Location:** `scripts/test-email-invitation.js`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Set your test email
$env:TEST_EMAIL="your-test-email@example.com"

# Run the test (must be authenticated in the app first)
node scripts/test-email-invitation.js
```

**What it tests:**
- ‚úÖ Authentication status
- ‚úÖ Group access
- ‚úÖ SMTP Edge Function connectivity
- ‚úÖ Invitation creation in database
- ‚úÖ Email sending with full HTML template
- ‚úÖ Environment variables
- ‚úÖ Token generation and URL formatting

---

### 2. **Browser Console Logs**
The invitation code now includes extensive logging:

**Look for these logs when inviting a user:**
```
üìß Email delivery check: { enableSmtp: true, ... }
‚úÖ SMTP enabled, sending email...
üì§ Invoking smtp-send function...
üì¨ SMTP result: { ... }
```

**If you see:**
- ‚ùå `SMTP function error:` ‚Üí Check Edge Function logs
- ‚ùå `SMTP send failed:` ‚Üí Check SMTP credentials
- ‚úÖ `emailSent: true` ‚Üí Email was sent successfully

---

### 3. **Supabase Dashboard Checks**

**Edge Function Logs:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/edwjkqbrvcoqsrfxqtyu/logs/edge-functions
2. Filter by `smtp-send`
3. Look for recent invocations
4. Check for errors like:
   - Connection timeouts
   - Authentication failures
   - SMTP errors

**Database Invitations:**
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  invitee_email, 
  status, 
  created_at,
  token
FROM invitations
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Check if invitations are being created successfully.

- [ ] Verify these 8 secrets exist:
  - `SMTP_HOST` = `smtp.gmail.com`
  - `SMTP_PORT` = `465`
  - `SMTP_SECURE` = `true`
  - `SMTP_USERNAME` = `chaipaaniapp@gmail.com`
  - `SMTP_PASSWORD` = `[your app password]`
  - `SMTP_FROM_EMAIL` = `chaipaaniapp@gmail.com`
  - `SMTP_FROM_NAME` = `ChaiPaani`

## üéØ RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Re-deploy the Edge Function** (critical - fixes the corrupted code)
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy smtp-send --no-verify-jwt
   ```

2. **Check your spam folder thoroughly**
   - Emails might already be there

3. **Run the diagnostic script**
   ```bash
   $env:TEST_EMAIL="your-test-email@example.com"
   node scripts/test-email-invitation.js
   ```

4. **Monitor browser console** when inviting users
   - Look for the emoji logs (üìß, ‚úÖ, ‚ùå)

### Short-term Improvements:
1. **Add plain text email version**
   - Currently only HTML is sent
   - Some email clients prefer/require plain text

2. **Improve email deliverability:**
   - Add SPF, DKIM, DMARC records (requires custom domain)
   - Use a dedicated transactional email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
   - Add footer with sender info and unsubscribe link

3. **Better error reporting to users:**
   - Show email send status in UI
   - Display "Check spam folder" message
   - Provide "Resend invitation" button

### Long-term Considerations:
1. **Switch to professional email service** (Recommended)
   - Gmail is not ideal for transactional emails
   - Consider: SendGrid, AWS SES, Mailgun, Postmark
   - Better deliverability and analytics

2. **Add email tracking**
   - Track when emails are opened
   - Track when links are clicked
   - Monitor bounce rates

3. **Implement retry logic**
   - Auto-retry failed emails
   - Queue emails for async processing

## üìù TESTING SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: New User Invitation
**Expected Flow:**
1. User A creates a group
2. User A invites user B by email
3. User B receives email within 1-2 minutes
4. User B clicks invitation link
5. User B is redirected to app with token in URL
6. User B signs up with the invited email
7. User B automatically sees the group in dashboard

**Test this:**
```bash
# Use your personal email
$env:TEST_EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
node scripts/test-email-invitation.js
```

### Scenario 2: Resend Invitation
**Expected Flow:**
1. User A sees pending invitation in group members list
2. User A clicks "Resend invitation"
3. User B receives reminder email
4. Rest same as Scenario 1

**Test this:** Use the "Resend" button in the add-members modal

### Scenario 3: Multiple Invitations
**Expected Flow:**
1. User A invites 3 users at once
2. All 3 receive emails
3. All 3 can accept and join

**Test this:** Invite multiple test emails in sequence

## üîê SECURITY NOTES

### Current Security Status: ‚úÖ Good
- ‚úÖ Emails are lowercase-normalized
- ‚úÖ PII (emails) are masked in logs (only domain shown)
- ‚úÖ Tokens are UUIDs (cryptographically secure)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies protect invitation data
- ‚úÖ Only group creators can invite members
- ‚úÖ SMTP password not logged
- ‚úÖ Timeout protection prevents hanging

### No Action Required on Security Front

---

## üìä SUMMARY

### ‚úÖ FIXED (Committed & Pushed):
1. Corrupted `withTimeout` function in Edge Function
2. Malformed `inviteUser` function with missing error handling
3. Duplicate `resendInvite` function
4. Incomplete `acceptInviteById` stub

### üîß ACTION REQUIRED:
1. **Deploy fixed Edge Function** (critical!)
2. **Check spam folder** (most likely location of emails)
3. **Run diagnostic script** to verify everything works
4. **Monitor console logs** when testing invitations

### üìß MOST LIKELY ISSUE:
**Emails are being sent but landing in spam folder.**

Gmail is very aggressive with new senders. This is completely normal and expected for new email-sending apps.

### üéØ NEXT STEP:
```bash
# 1. Re-deploy Edge Function
supabase functions deploy smtp-send --no-verify-jwt

# 2. Test email sending
$env:TEST_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
node scripts/test-email-invitation.js

# 3. CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER!
```
