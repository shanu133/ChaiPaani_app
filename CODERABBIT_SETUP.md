## Example CodeRabbit Review

When you create a PR, CodeRabbit might comment:

```markdown
## üê∞ CodeRabbit Review

**Overall**: Great implementation! Found a few suggestions to improve security and performance.

### Summary
- 7 files changed
- 2,500+ lines added
- 3 security suggestions
- 5 best practice improvements

### Key Findings

#### üîí Security
1. **[HIGH]** Add email validation in Edge Function
   - File: `supabase/functions/smtp-send/index.ts:25`
   - Missing input validation could lead to injection attacks
   - Suggestion: Add regex validation before using `emailTo`

#### ‚ö° Performance
2. **[MEDIUM]** Consider pagination for invitation lists
   - File: `src/components/add-members-modal.tsx:45`
   - Loading all invitations could be slow with many records
   - Suggestion: Add `.range(0, 20)` to limit results

#### ‚ú® Best Practices
3. **[LOW]** Extract email template to separate file
   - File: `src/lib/supabase-service.ts:78`
   - Improves maintainability and allows template testing
   - Suggestion: Create `src/lib/email-templates.ts`

### Walkthrough
<details>
<summary>View file-by-file analysis</summary>

**src/components/smtp-settings-modal.tsx**
- Clean implementation with good UX
- Properly handles loading states
- ‚úÖ Correctly avoids storing password in localStorage

**supabase/functions/smtp-send/index.ts**
- Good CORS setup
- Missing input validation (see suggestion #1)
- Consider adding rate limiting
